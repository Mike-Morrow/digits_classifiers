Walk through of common ML classifiers

We'll walk through a simple ML workflow 

1) loading in data from csv
2) [standardizing](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.scale.html) our dataset for the classifiers 
3) splitting into [training and test](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) 
4) trying out various classifiers 
5) evaluating the results using various metrics. [see link for exhaustive list of evaluation metrics](https://github.com/benhamner/Metrics)
